		   * A name in java program is called "identifire"
		   * Simply it is used for identification purpose
		   * it can be method name or variable name or class name or lable name
		 
		 	class test {
		 	public static void main(String[] args)

		 	 test, main, String, args, x === these all are identifires
		 	 
		 	 
		 	 
		 	 Rules to define java identifiers: 
		 	 
				Rule 1: The only allowed characters in java identifiers are: 
				1) a to z 
				2) A to Z 
				3) 0 to 9 
				4) _ (underscore) 
				5) $ 
				
				Rule 2: If we are using any other character we will get compile time error. 
				Example: 
				1) total_number-------valid 
				2) Total#------------------invalid 
				
				Rule 3: identifiers are not allowed to starts with digit.
				Example: 
				1) ABC123---------valid 
				2) 123ABC---------invalid 
				
				Rule 4: java identifiers are case sensitive up course java language itself treated as case 
				sensitive language. 
				Example: 
				class Test{ 
				int number=10; 
				int Number=20; 
				int NUMBER=20; we can differentiate with case. 
				int NuMbEr=30; 
				} 
				
				Rule 5: There is no length limit for java identifiers but it is not recommended to take 
				more than 15 lengths. 
				
				Rule 6: We can't use reserved words as identifiers. 
				Example: 
				 int if=10; --------------invalid
				 
				Rule 7: All predefined java class names and interface names we use as identifiers. 
				
				Example 1: 
				class Test 
				{ 
				public static void main(String[] args){ 
				int String=10; 
				System.out.println(String); 
				}} 
				Output: 
				10 
				
				Example 2: 
				class Test 
				{ 
				public static void main(String[] args){ 
				int Runnable=10; 
				System.out.println(Runnable); 
				}} 
				Output: 
				10 
				Even though it is legal to use class names and interface names as identifiers but it is not 
				a good programming practice.
