 		Map Interface 
		--------------- 
		• Map is an interface which stores the objects as a key value pair. 
		• Each key,value pair is called as entry. 
		• So map is also referred as collection of entry objects 
		• Whenever we want to represents objects as key value pair we go for maps. 
		• Map interface is implemented by 3 different classes 
			1. HASHMAP 
			2. LINKEDHASHMAP 
			3. TREEMAP
 		
 		* If you want to represent a group of objects as key value pairs then we go for map(I) 
 		   Example :-  			
 		      			Employees
 		     Employee Id's		Employee Names 		
	 	    	 Key				Value
	 		     101				Shaik
	 		     102				Abdul	
	 		     103				Baji
	 		     104				Rasool
	 		     
	 	* " Combination of Key and Vayue pair is called Entry "
	 	* A group of Entries(Each entry is called key value pair) is called map
