	 	* Are there any restrictions or any differences btw the fields created in abstract and 
	 	  normal classes ? No.
	 	
	 	For abstract classes there are no restrictions for creating variables the variables inside
	 	the abstract classes are same as variables in normal classes.
	 	eg : public or private or protected or static or final int speed;
	 	
	 	For interfaces there are restrictions they accept only static and final, if you forget to give 
	 	the access modifier it will defaultly taken as static and final
