 	Interface :-
 	-------------
 	* Interfaces looks "similar to classes" eg : In place of class their is interface
 	* Interfaces are "extension of abstract classes"
 	* In abstract class partial implementation is done
 	* In interface fully implementation is done
 	* The purpose of the interface is to provide a common behave or that can be used by several classes by implementing 
 	  the interface
 	  * Interface is like a contract or norm or standard, that can be implemented or followed by classes
 	   
 	Difference btw Abstract class and Interface ?
 		
 	abstract class					Extension					Interface
 	--------------------------------	|	 ------------------------------	
 	public abstract class ClassOne()			public interface InterfaceOne()
 	{											{
 		public void methodA()					
 		{
 													public void methodA();
 		}							
 		
 		public abstract void methodB()				public void methodB();
 		{
 		
 		}
 	
 	}										     }
 		
 	Conclusion :								Conclusion :
 	* abstract classes have both abstract 		* By default all interfaces methods are abstract type only
 	  methods and non-abstract methods            and 
 	* In this have both implemented and 
 	  unimplemented methods
 	
 	
 	
 	Purpose of Interface :-
 	-----------------------
 	* Common behaviour
 	* Contract
 	* Norm
 	* Standard 
 	
 	eg : Bank example
 	* Bank is interface and hdfc and axis and icici are implemented classes
 	* when we implements a class with interface it will implement umimplemented methods
