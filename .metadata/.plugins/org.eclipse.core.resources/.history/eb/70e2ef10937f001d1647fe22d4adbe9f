 	Interface :-
 	-------------
 	* Interfaces looks similar to classes eg : In place of class their is interface
 	* Interfaces are extension of abstract classes
 	* In abstract class partial implementation is done
 	* In interface fully implementation is done
 		
 	abstract class					Extension					Interface

 	 Conclusion :								Conclusion :
 	* abstract classes have both abstract 		* By default all interfaces methods are abstract type only
 	  methods and non-abstract methods            and 
 	* In this have both implemented and 
 	  unimplemented methods
