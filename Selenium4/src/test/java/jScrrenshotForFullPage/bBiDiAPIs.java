		 * Selenium 4 is now using W3C WebDriver Protocol, and is moving in the direction of the next generation protocol i.e. WebDriver BiDirectional Protocol.
			Currently as per todays date (24th Nov, 2021), it is in draft mode and not completed yet.
			Selenium WebDriver team is working with different Browser vendors on this WebDriver Bidirectional Protocol
			With this protocol, we can achieve automating browser level things the Getting Browser logs, Browser Level Authentication, Changing Geo-location and many more with all Selenium supported Browsers. 
			Reference Links:
			https://w3c.github.io/webdriver-bidi/
			As this protocol is in draft mode, only way for us to get browser logs, browser level authentication, changing geo-location etc is by using an external Protocol i.e. Chrome DevTools Protocol, which is not supported by All Browser and is not much stable yet. 
			Only Chrome, Firefox and Edge are supporting this protocol for now. 
			More about the currently available Chrome DevTools Protocol will be explained in the next session
